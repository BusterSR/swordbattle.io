one sec i will make sure this code is up to date k seems smoother

one thing can you fork the github swordbattle.io code? yes

so that when you make changes you have a seperate place to keep track of them
ok forked

i remember i played the og version but when u wold gett big small players could go inside of you lol

lol

ok everythings up to date

i just need to tell you one thing
wheen your making changes
have an empty shell open
running the command `npm run watch` 

its to automatically build the client code ok ok I will ill stay up to date on discord should I also buy a domain

no no that's not necessary, just work on here, take a few days to familiarize with the code, then just look at swordbattle and try to add all the missing features one by one

i will prepare the google s
ok enjoy, lmk  if you have quesrtions on discord, let me know your progress by tonight
heet soon but idk if you already know the requirements its not worth it lol ok brb my parents ag=re getting icecream

ty again
 wait maybe we can make the background fanart to attract players
np
maybe in future, right now lets focus on implementing new features, i want this to be fully done before new years ok ok sure see u soon
